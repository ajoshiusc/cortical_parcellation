\begin_layout Abstract
We present a method for comparing fMRI signal across scans allowing for
 direct comparisons of functional activations in fMRI study.
 The method allows for temporal alignment of the signal so that they can
 be directly compared from one brain to the other.

Data

\begin_layout Standard
We used the minimally preprocessed (ICA-FIX denoised) resting fMRI data
 from 40 unrelated subjects, which are publicly available from the Human
 Connectome Project (HCP) (Van Essen et al., 2013; Glasser et al., 2013; Smith
 et al., 2013; Barch et al., 2013; Woolrich et al., 2013).
 The resting fMRI data were resampled onto the individualsâ€™ cortical surfaces,
 which were coregistered using FreeSurfer.
 The functional MRI data sets were acquired for four independent resting
 fMRI sessions of 15 minutes each (TR=720ms, TE=33.1ms, 2 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm
 voxels) and the subjects were asked to relax and fixate on a projected
 bright cross-hair on a dark background.
 HCP's minimal preprocessing primarily corrects the fMRI data for acquisition
 artifacts, resamples the data on the cortical surface and performs a non-aggres
sive spatio-temporal cleanup (Glasser et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013).
 The data are then resampled for each subject onto a common standard cortical
 surface mesh representation (32K Conte-69) in the native subject space
 (Smith et al., 2013; Van Essen et al., 2012).
 Additional spatial-temporal processing is then used to remove scanner,
 motion and other artifacts (Smith et al., 2013).In addition to this processing,
 we also applied temporal non-local means (tNLM) filter

.
 The tNLM filtering is shown to improve the performance of parcellation
 algorithms by enhancing local correlations between the datasets.
 Additionally, we normalized the resting fMRI time series at each vertex
 to zero mean and unit variance.

Discussion and Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the assumptions is that the correlation structure of the brain images
 is constant over time.
 However we know that there are subtle yet consistent changes in connectivity
 over time.
 changes It is possible to develop a windowed version of BrainSync.
